# Swagger API Documentation for Express Application

This repository contains an Express application that integrates Swagger API documentation. The Swagger UI allows developers to explore and interact with the API endpoints easily. It provides detailed information about the available routes, request/response schemas, and sample requests.

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

### `git clone <repository-url>`

2. Install the dependencies:

### `cd <repository-folder>`
### `npm install`

3. Start the server:

### `npm start`

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/api-docs to access the Swagger UI.
Use the Swagger UI to explore the available API endpoints, request/response schemas, and make sample requests.

## API Endpoints

The Express application provides the following API endpoints:

#### GET /api/health: Health endpoint to check the server status.
#### GET /api/products: Retrieve all products.
#### GET /api/products/{productId}: Get a specific product by ID.
#### POST /api/products: Create a new product.
#### PUT /api/products/{productId}: Update a product by ID.
#### DELETE /api/products/{productId}: Delete a product by ID.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is generated using Swagger. The Swagger UI provides an interactive interface to explore and test the API endpoints. It also describes the request/response schemas and provides sample requests.

To access the API documentation, start the server and navigate to http://localhost:3000/api-docs in your web browser.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are used in this project:

##### express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
##### body-parser: Node.js body parsing middleware.
##### swagger-jsdoc: Swagger JSDoc allows you to write OpenAPI specs using JSDoc comments.
##### swagger-ui-express: Middleware to serve Swagger UI generated from the Swagger JSDoc.
##### cors: CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
